# Privacy Policy Texts for Chrome Web Store

## Single Purpose

```
Pixel Grid is a developer tool that displays a customizable grid overlay on web pages. The extension serves this single purpose only and does not collect any data.
```

---

## Data Collection

```
None. Pixel Grid does not collect personal data, usage statistics, or transmit any information to external servers.
```

---

## Data Usage

```
No data is collected or used. The extension only stores local settings (grid dimensions, colors, opacity) on the user's device using Chrome's local storage.
```

---

## Data Sharing

```
None. No data is shared with third parties as no data is collected.
```

---

## Permissions

```
- activeTab: To inject the grid overlay on the current webpage
- storage: To store settings locally on the user's device
```

---

## Reasons for Permissions

**activeTab:**
```
This permission is required to display the grid overlay on the currently open webpage. The extension injects a visual overlay element into the page's DOM to render the grid. No data is read or extracted from the page.
```

**storage:**
```
This permission is needed to store the user's settings (grid dimensions, colors, opacity, offsets) locally on the device. The data remains exclusively on the user's device and is not transmitted to external servers.
```

**Host Permissions (http://*/*, https://*/*):**
```
This permission is required to inject the grid overlay on any webpage the user visits. Pixel Grid is designed to work on any website to help developers and designers check alignment and spacing. The extension only injects a visual overlay element and does not read, modify, or extract any data from the pages. The overlay is purely visual and does not interact with page content.
```

---

## Data Storage

```
All settings are stored exclusively locally on the user's device (chrome.storage.local). No data is stored on external servers.
```
